# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Join Us!
The projects in our lab are centered around primary patient samples or pre-clinical modeling and are highly trans-disciplinary. They are situated at the interface of functional (single-cell) multi-omics, computational biology and (spatial) imaging to better understand the principles that steer changes in complex multicellular tissues. You will be working together with experts in these fields and will have the opportunity to be trained in one or more fields to become a well-rounded researcher. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving technological setups, performing experiments, and/or analyzing obtained datasets.

Since our lab atmosphere is highly collaborative we particularly encourage applications from individuals that have an open mind and work well in a team setting. Each person will have the opportunity to be the chief of their own project(s), but will be asked to give and take advice in a positive and constructive manner.

# Current Openings


#### Undergraduate Position in Computational Biology (UROP)

Undergraduate Research Position - Spatial Transcriptomics and Data Science in Cancer Biology

The Dries Lab at Boston University is seeking a motivated undergraduate student to contribute to research projects focusing on various tumors using spatial transcriptomic technologies, imaging and 3D tissue modeling, and bioinformatics software tools. Our lab is situated at the forefront of spatial omics research and develops Giotto Suite [Giotto](www.giottosuite.com), a widely used R package for spatial omics data analysis. We encourage undergraduates with a background in programming, data analysis, and/or cancer biology, as well as an interest for translational research to apply. No prior lab experience is required. The roles offers an oportunity to explore the latest advances in cancer research within a multi-disciplinary lab environment while gaining valuable experience in computational workflows. See [UROP link](https://www.bu.edu/urop/opportunity/computational-biology/) for more information and instructions on how to apply.
