# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Join Us!
The projects in our lab are centered around primary patient samples or pre-clinical modeling and are highly trans-disciplinary. They are situated at the interface of functional (single-cell) multi-omics, computational biology and (spatial) imaging to better understand the principles that steer changes in complex multicellular tissues. You will be working together with experts in these fields and will have the opportunity to be trained in one or more fields to become a well-rounded researcher. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving technological setups, performing experiments, and/or analyzing obtained datasets.

Since our lab atmosphere is highly collaborative we particularly encourage applications from individuals that have an open mind and work well in a team setting. Each person will have the opportunity to be the chief of their own project(s), but will be asked to give and take advice in a positive and constructive manner.

# Current Openings

#### Postdoctoral Fellow

The fellow would primarily be working on a project investigating the spatial drivers of the lung (pre-)metastatic niche in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is the most common childhood bone tumor, and despite recent advances, is associated with a poor prognosis. Understanding the metastatic process from the primary bone location to the lungs will be essential to identify and target novel vulnerabilities. Using the resources of the newly established Spatial Imaging Core, including an in situ spatial omics platform, the fellow will study the microenvironmental influences of lung metastasis. This exciting project would involve working with renowned collaborators across multiple institutions including bioinformaticians, wet-lab scientists, and clinicians.
