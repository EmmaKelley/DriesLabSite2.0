# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Join Us!
The projects in our lab are centered around primary patient samples or pre-clinical modeling and are highly trans-disciplinary. They are situated at the interface of functional (single-cell) multi-omics, computational biology and (spatial) imaging to better understand the principles that steer changes in complex multicellular tissues. You will be working together with experts in these fields and will have the opportunity to be trained in one or more fields to become a well-rounded researcher. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving technological setups, performing experiments, and/or analyzing obtained datasets.

Since our lab atmosphere is highly collaborative we particularly encourage applications from individuals that have an open mind and work well in a team setting. Each person will have the opportunity to be the chief of their own project(s), but will be asked to give and take advice in a positive and constructive manner.

# Current Openings

#### Spatial Research Technician

The Dries lab seeks to hire a research technician with a strong interest in in spatial biology,
pathology and tissue histology. See the [application](Ads/Dries_lab_spatial_research_technician_v2.pdf) for more details.

&nbsp;  

#### Postdoctoral Fellow(s) in Spatial biology & software engineering

We're looking for enthusiastic postdoctoral fellow(s) with an interest in spatial multi-omics. Ideally, this person has prior expertise in one or more of the following skills:   
- data science / analysis  
- R and software engineering
- imaging  or image processing  
- genomics  
- spatial method development  
- deep-learning

We're specifically looking for talented individuals that want to develop new methods working with large and/or multi-modal
spatial datasets. High-level R coding and package development to support our [Giotto Suite](https://giottosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) platform are considered a big plus. In this role the fellow can also directly interact with our excellent (under)graduate students and provide mentorship and support where needed. Each individual will be given the opportunity to carve out an individual growth trajectory that matches their previous expertise and future goals.

If interested, please email a CV and a letter of intent to [Ruben](mailto:rdries@bu.edu).
