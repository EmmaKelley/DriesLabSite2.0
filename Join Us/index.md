# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Join Us!
The projects in our lab are often centered around clinical data or pre-clinical modeling and are highly trans-disciplinary. They are situated at the interface of functional (single-cell) multi-omics, computational biology and (spatial) imaging to better understand the principles that steer changes in complex multicellular tissues. You will be working together with experts in these fields and will have the opportunity to be trained in one or more fields to become a well-rounded researcher. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving technological setups, performing experiments, and/or analyzing obtained datasets.

Since our lab atmosphere is highly collaborative we particularly encourage applications from individuals that have an open mind and work well in a team setting. Each person will have the opportunity to be the chief of their own project(s), but will be asked to give and take advice in a positive and constructive manner.

# Current Openings

#### Postdoctoral Fellow

The fellow would primarily be working on a project investigating the spatial drivers of the lung (pre-)metastatic niche in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is the most common childhood bone tumor, and despite recent advances, is associated with a poor prognosis. Understanding the metastatic process from the primary bone location to the lungs will be essential to identify and target novel vulnerabilities. Using the resources of the newly established Spatial Imaging Core, including an in situ spatial omics platform, the fellow will study the microenvironmental influences of lung metastasis. This exciting project would involve working with renowned collaborators across multiple institutions including bioinformaticians, wet-lab scientists, and clinicians.

#### Lab Manager

The lab manager will provide research and operational support for both the experimental and computational components of the lab. This role is approximately 60% bench research, 15% data analysis and writing, and 25% logistical and administrative support, but is flexible depending on the applicant’s interest. Research focus will be on understanding how the cellular microenvironment contributes to breast cancer development and resistance to therapy. The lab manager will work closely with clinical and scientific collaborators and members in the lab.
 
Responsibilities will span the research process and include experimental work, data analysis and interpretation, and logistical support of a mid-sized academic research lab. The lab manager will be responsible for processing and collecting patient samples to ensure successful storage and access of the generated datasets. The lab manager will also help to develop 3D breast cancer models, including maintaining cell lines, running quantitative and qualitative analyses of the project, and helping with the experimental design. There will also be opportunities to contribute to manuscript preparation, grant writing, and literature review. As lab manager, this position will include some logistical responsibilities, including ordering, lab safety, assisting in the recruitment and training of undergraduates, and other issues as they arise.

#### Junior Bioinformatician

The applicant’s work will include maintaining our in-house developed Giotto platform (giottosuite.com), analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets, and identifying and implementing the best solutions for large data processing, visualization and spatial data analysis algorithms. We offer a unique inclusive environment and the opportunity to explore and work with new cutting edge tools to develop the skills aspiring scientists in software development and bioinformatics will need.
