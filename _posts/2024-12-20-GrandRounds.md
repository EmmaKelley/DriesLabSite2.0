Every year BUMC hosts a Grand Rounds seminar where researchers in the Hematology and Medical Oncology department can present their projects and literature. This year, our very own Dr. Ko and Dr. Dries presented on the collaboration between our two labs to all the Hematology/Oncology faculty and staff. It's hard to see the big picture when working in the lab day in and day out, working through successes and failures big or small. This presentation is an inspiring reminder of why we do what we do, thank you both for a wonderful year!
