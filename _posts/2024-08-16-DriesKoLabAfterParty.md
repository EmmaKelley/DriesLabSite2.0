The Dries and Ko Labs gathered at Dr. Naomi Ko's house for a get together to celebrate the teams at BUMC and BMC. Time quickly passed from afternoon to evening as everyone laughed and chatted into the night while feasting on the delicious dishes. The spotlight was on Tam and Fenway (dogs) as they travelled through the crowd earning many praises and pats. We tied off the day with a ping-pong tournament, crowning Jeff as the new champion, dethroning Ruben. The prize is limited bragging rights and a slightly bigger ego. 

Ruben insists on another tournament soon.
