Jason Weis received an honorable mention from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. 
We have no doubt that he will excel in his graduate studies in the lab!

The Dries lab is excited to receive a grant from the American Cancer Society (ACS) to pilot the establishment of clinical biopsy pipelines at Boston Medical Center, in collaboration with BMC, and to build the workflows and tools for applying multiplexed spatial in-situ RNA profiling (MERFISH) on primary breast cancer samples.
