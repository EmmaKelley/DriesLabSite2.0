The BU/BMC Hematology-Oncology Section hosted its first Summer Outreach program this year. Boston high schoolers with an interest in science were recommended by their 
teachers to join our floor for a week, learning about biomedical research. Dries lab members taught the high schoolers about DNA replication and cancer cell development
and taught pipetting and H&E staining. It was great to be a part of this week, break down misconceptions about working in science, and meet future scientists!
