Evans day this year was a great time for our lab members. We had the opportunity to see posters from four of our members, both current and alumni; Eddie, George, Junxiang, and Sophia. All of our presenters did a great job explaining their research projects to give others a better idea of what they do! Congratulations to all of them and a special shout out and happy birthday wishes to Eddie!
