A new lab member just dropped! Mason is joining the Ko lab as a clinical research assistant, he will be aiding Dr. Naomi Ko in consenting patients. Naomi describes Mason as "charming." Now put that charm to work, we look forward to working with you! Make sure to visit the Dries Lab often. 

Update: Since Mason has joined, he's consented an astounding number of patients and earned the Dries and Ko lab a huge number of both blood and tissue samples. Charming is a most apt description.
