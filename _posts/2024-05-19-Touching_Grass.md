On a rainy Sunday the Dries Lab strapped up their boots and sneakers for a nature walk at World's End. Kim and Fran joined along for the leisurely stroll and many pictures were taken to record the wondrous day. Michelle was the most prepared for the hike, her bright jacket leading the way, though Junxiang's Jordans were the MVP of the day. Most memorable was the walk along a very short isthmus with crabs and other shells washed up along the thin shores. Quynh was on the hunt for a four leaf clover and after much laborious searching, she found one. Not even a minute after, Ruben popped up with a five leaf clover, truly befitting of the Dries Lab's PI. 

Thank you for the lunch, Ruben!
