On Friday August 5th, the Dries lab said Goodbye to our lab manager Emma Kelley. Emma was a part of the Dries lab for 2 years and made quite an impact. She will be starting a masters
program in genetic counseling at University of Michigan. We would like to wish Emma the best of luck in her future endeavors.
